# My Portfolio

I'm not your typical web developer. I have a background in copywriting, marketing, psychology, and education. How does this come into play with my web apps?

Quite simply, it forces me to create web apps with the end user in mind. I'm constantly thinking "Where does the user's eyes naturally go when they're on this page?" or "How does this color scheme work for this target audience."

Sometimes the prettiest websites are the hardest to navigate. It's my goal to create simple, easy-to-navigate apps and webpages that makes the user's experience one they won't forget.
