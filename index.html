                    <p>When people go to your website, what actions do you want them to take? Of course you want them to buy your products or read
        another blog post, right?</p>
        <p>But how do you get them to do it without being blatantly obvious or turning off potential customers? That's where I come in.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Shay Banks and I am a UX Designer. For over a decade, I've helped entrepreneurs, small business owners,
            and organizations stand out on the web by creating unique web designs that are attractive, responsive,
            user-friendly, and interactive.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Anyone can make a pretty website, there are tons of templates out there that can accomplish that. But it
            takes science and art to understand your target market's motivations, desires, and habits. Once you have
            that data, you'll need to translate that into a website that makes them take the action you want.</p>

        <p> I can make sure that your website helps you achieve your goals. If you would like to discover how I can help
            your next project kick bootay and rake in the dough, click on the contact tab above and fill out the
            form on that page.</p></div>
