                <h1>Insurance Trivia Game</h1>
                <div>
                <img src="./images/insurancetrivasnap.png" class="img-fluid" align:"right" id="photo" class="responsive"></div>
                <p> Can we agree that insurance is a pretty boring topic? But it's the one asset that everyone
                    needs. Whether you're buing a car, a home, computer equipment, or traveling to a different city,
                    everyone wants to know if something goes wrong, they have something in place to protect them.

                    <p>But when most consumers think of insurance, they think price first, coverage second. This is why
                        you see so many "Save $500 when you switch to our insurance" ads. They work, if you're looking
                        for price shoppers.</p>

                    <h3>But studies show that an educated consumer are willing to purchase at a higher price and are
                        more loyal to brands they trust.</h3>
                    <p> So how do you get those types of customers? By creating an interactive experience that helps
                        them learn while also being entertained.</p>
                    <p> This is why this app was created. It's a fun way to capture leads, build trust, and increase
                        social media shares.</p> 
                        <p></p>

                <h1>The Ultimate Organizer</h1>
                <img src="./images/project3jumbotron.PNG" class="img-fluid" align:"right" id="photo" class="responsive">
                <p>In today's busy world, it's hard for most families to stay organized.</p>

                    <p> That's why in this app, as a collaboration team, we decided to create a calendar app using React.Js.</p>
                
                <p>I was responsible for the front end design and overall color scheme. When I checked out competitor's landing pages, I saw a similar theme of selling features. They would say things like "accessible on all devices" and "perfect for families".</p>
                <p> But, there was something major missing: the end user's why.</p>

                <p>By doing a little customer research, I was able to extract what customer's were looking for in a calendar app. I mean, with so many free options available like Google Calendar, why wasn't that enough? What was missing? I took that information and created a design and landing page that spoke to those spoken (and unspoken) desires. </p>

                <h1>Get GIPHY With It</h1>
                <img src="./images/keywords-2446792_1920.png" class="img-fluid" align:"right" id="photo" class="responsive">
                <p>Let's have a little fun, shall we? In this app, I used the GIPHY API to create a fun experience for anyone who visits the page.</p>
                <p>By simply clicking on the buttons, a specific set of dancing images will appear in the browser. You can even add your very own buttons and they will magically (with the help of our good friend JQuery) appear on the webpage.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Besides being fun, this is clever way to increase engagement on a webpage and reduce your site's bounce rate.</p>

                <p>I know they say "content is king" on the web. That is a true statement, but how that content is delivered should vary based on the target audience. In this case, this app is for a younger audience with a ton of energy.</p>

                <p> Let's have some more fun.</p>
                <p>As a former teacher, I understand the importance of making learning fun. If you want to challenege someone's memory or knowledge, why not create a game to test them?</p>
                
                <p>According to UMASS-Amherst, Centre for Teaching and Faculty Development, games can be used to increase learning outcomes.</p>
                <p>In this particular app, your memory and math skills will be tested. What's even cooler is that this was built using what I call the Big 4: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.</p>
